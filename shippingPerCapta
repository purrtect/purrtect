This file describes the carbon footprint of different shipping modes
Each type of shipping will use a mix of multiple shipping modes (kg/km)

Prime:
Assume 80% of the distance travelled is by air
       20% of the distance travelled is by truck

Assume 80% of the distance travelled is by train
       20% of the distance travelled is by truck
